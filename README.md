Create an HTML table that shows what happens when you attempt to coerce each of the below into the following primitive types: number, string, boolean.

undefined
  null
  true
  false
  ""
  "1.2"
  "one"
  0
  -0
  NaN
  Infinity
  -Infinity
  1
  {}
  []
  [12]
  ['something']
  function(){}

## Notes
    Your table should have a minimum of 4 columns, one showing the starting values, and one showing the result of the coercion into each type.
    Make sure your table has a a table header and is properly formatted when you view it as a webpage.
